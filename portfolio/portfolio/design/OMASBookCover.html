		<h1>The Old Man and the Sea Book Cover</h1>
		<section class='thin'>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>For this project the goal was to design three covers for a book from the library of congress’s most influential books list. We were allowed to choose the book that we would like to design the cover for. For each of the three covers we were to follow a different set of rules.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Type Only</li>
				<li>Physical Creation (Photography, collage, ETC.)</li>
				<li>Designer’s Choice</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>My Choice</h3>
			<p>Choosing a book was very difficult. I like to read, but surprisingly I hadn’t read many of them. I really enjoy a simple story without too much complication so in the end I chose as my book</p>
			<p class='centered'><b>The Old Man and The Sea
				by Ernest Hemingway</b></p>

			<p>The Old Man and The Sea I really did enjoy reading the book. At some points though it proved hard to find symbolism and other things we were encouraged to look for in order to create a good and meaningful cover. While there was symbolism it was often ambiguous. The moral could be argued from several perspectives.</p>

			<p>The old man says several things while he is out fishing alone that provoke quite a bit of thought, and might give some clue to the moral of the book. He says:
				<i>“But man is not made for defeat, A man can be destroyed but not defeated.”</i> </p>

			<p>We could argue it is about the strength of the old man. He later says:
				<i>“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy. But since I am not, I do not care.” </i></p>

			<p>In some ways he is depicted as noble and in others he is crazy. Simply put an old man goes out to fish and we get a glimpse of his experience. It is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a simple thought provoking story. </p>

			<p>There are many lessons to be learned from the book. I doubt many people will learn the same thing from reading it.</p>

			<h3>Research and Sketching</h3>

			<p>It can be good to look at simular things other designers have done to get excited and motivated about a project, as well as get a few good ideas to try out once we get into the sketching phase.</p>

			<p>Sketching was the a very successful part of my project. I felt like I was able to generate plenty of ideas and pick out from the group concepts that really worked I really enjoyed reading the book. I might just go back the book list for his assignment if I ever need another good book to read.</p>

			<h3>Multiple Aproaches</h3>
			
			<p>I tried a couple of different things when designing the book cover. There where some ideas that I would have liked to explore further, but I only had so much time. here are a few of the book covers I looked at.</p>
			
			<div class='triple'>

				<img src='Images/omas/fishre.jpg'>
				<img src='Images/omas/type.jpg'>
			</div>
		
			<h3>Print and Prep.</h3>

			<p>I had a lot of problems with getting things print ready. I couldn’t get good pictures or scans of some of the covers, and with my type. Overall I Really Like the concepts, but It I couldn’t get things to work out. I plan on working on these more because i think they could have been super great, but nothing was working out for me. If nothing else I will get better photographs or scans of the second two and get a color for the first that prints right, and update the prject. I spent so much time trying to get colors and prints right that I lost time to finish the process book. The color for the type cover was One of the worst parts. I ended up making the back super light blue because everything kept printing so dark.</p>
