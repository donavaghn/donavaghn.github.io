		<h1>Business Cards</h1>
		<section class='thin'>
			
			<h3>Purpose</h3>

			<p>We need to know what the goal of the project is. In the case of business cards, if we don’t know that their purpose is to make contact between people easy, than we wont make a business card that express this information in a good way.</p>

			<p>Business cards are a good way for people to give contact information in a quick easy way. It allows for future contact between people when it might be hard to reach the other.</p>

			<p>The person giving the card creates the possibility for future contact with the people he gives the cards to. Career wise this is very important because he most likely needs contact from these people for future work and therefore income.</p>

			<p>The person receiving the card also benefits because contacting the giver becomes very easy, and they can easily request their service. If they talked to the person they know a little about their work and will not have to spend as much time looking for someone who can do what is needed.</p>

			<p>Doing business cards is different than other graphic design projects in a lot of ways. It’s interesting how with just words saying the same things in different places you feel like there cant be that much difference, but even small changes make a significant difference when you look back on it.</p>

			<h3>Research</h3>
			
			<img class='full' src='../../images/blue.jpg'>

			<p>I think some things that are really important are good hierarchy, balance, and it also important that it’s not too cluttered.</p>

			<h2>Concepts and Sketches</h2>
			
			<p>With thumbnails I try not to take it too seriously. I think it important to get out as many ideas as possible. Sometimes you don’t know if something will look good until you see it, even if in your head it sounds bad it might look good on paper. Sometimes it sounds good in your head but looks really bad on paper, so you really just need a rough draft to decide if it looks good or not. I try to spend as little time as possible sketching a thumbnail.</p>

			<h3>Digital Renditions</h3>

			<p>For me the hardest part was trying to block out the things I’ve already done, and try to have significant difference in each composition. It was really nice to be able to make quick examples so I could see what layout and style I personally like. I really haven’t dealt too much with business cards so it was great to see how it all works.</p>

			<h2>Final Draft</h2>
			
			<img class='right' src='../../images/blue.jpg'>

			<p>One thing I liked in my final business card was the use of negative space. From the thumbnail step it was one of my favorites, because the way the sides are empty makes it feel so much less crowded. I think that in a business card that might help people be more inclined to read over the information. Sadly now days people aren’t inclined to read anything long, so a card with a simpler feel is more likely to be read.</p>

			<p>You really have to consider all of the principles of design, but there are a few I took more into account than others. Using negative space is an important principle, another is balance. This is especially true on the back side I achieved balance by putting the majority of the design to the left, and some type to the right to balance it.</p>

			<p>One thing that can be hard to do with a business card is repetition and variation, with a small area and so many things that already have to be on it, there are only so many things you can do. But small variations can have a big effect.</p>
