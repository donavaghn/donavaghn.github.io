			<h3>Content of Booklet</h3>
			<p>My Peace I Leave with You<br> President Henry B. Eyring</p>

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>A lot of time while I working I think what should I do with this or what should I put here. It really doesn’t take that long to write down a bunch of ideas, but when your working on a project and need one, if you don’t have an idea written down it will take a lot longer too look through the talk or think back to the person your making it for just to come up with one idea. If you spend a few minutes thinking of ideas you will get into that mind set and they’ll come quickly.</p>

			<h3>Concepts and Sketches</h3>
			<p>The main point of the talk is that the spirit will bring you comfort. God wants us to be happy, so he tries to comfort us as a parent would comfort their child. If we are willing to follow God and be worthy of his spirit and seek it he will abundantly give us his spirit. If we have his spirit we will have the desire to do good, and in so doing become worthy to live with God again. If we have the spirit we will have the desire to do good, and in so doing become worthy to live with God again.</p>


			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>I chose my sister who has been married for about a year now and recently had her second child. They are both boys so light blue is fitting, and she is artistically inclined, so I figured she would appreciate complementary colors. Some parts of the design are just for design’s sake, but I do believe that a large part of it is what she would like.</p>

			<h3>Negative Space</h3>
			<p>As I got farther into it I realized that I will have a lot more negative space to work with than I thought, so the second draft will involve a lot of reorganizing negative space. I think reworking space will help improve the overall design a ton.</p>

			<p>It’s kind of hard to estimate how much space things will take up, but now that I know I hope I will be able to add larger bolder elements to the design, and spread the body more evenly throughout the book. I like when things are both simple and interesting. It’s always nice when the added elements really feel like they are where they’re meant to be.</p>

			<h3>Success in the Project</h3>
			<p>I think the thing I liked most about them is that they’re both simple and interesting. It’s always nice when the added elements really feel like they are where they’re meant to be. They were also the pages I spent more time on. I spent significantly more time on them, because they are the ones I used to decide how I want the book to look. I haven’t really spent the time to flush out the design with the others.</p>

			<h3>Challanges</h3>
			<p>One big challenge is trying to make each page feel like it has purpose. Another big challenge is making sure all the space is used well. There is a lot of space to cover and the composition has to be good. Doing a cover is something that is kind of hard to do because it has to be interesting and have a little more than just the text, yet all the added things have to be subordinate to and not take away from the type. It was hard to have a little bit of design that makes the words easier to read and not harder. in the end I really liked the cover I did for the first draft, so I plan to keep working with that one.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>One of the biggest things that I realized I needed to spend some time on after printing the test print was the spacing. I need some breathing room for the title on the front cover, and more space on the outside edges. Along with that I will spend some tome making sure the block quotes and subheadings have good spacing as well, the padding still needs a little work.</li>

				<li>The color also needs some work. I put this off a little so I could see how it looks printed. Seeing it now I think that was the right choice. I like the color, but it needs some slight adjustments to work right. I plan on making the blue on the inside pages darker and the orange on the inside front cover lighter. or maybe just do something different in that area.</li>

				<li>The other thing I plan on spending a lot of time on this week is the center page. I put a large quote there. I’ve managed to make it work a little better than last time by making it shorter, making the text larger, and the background lighter.</li>

			<h3>The Cover</h3>

			<p>Doing a cover is something that is kind of hard to do because it has to be interesting and have a little more than just the text, yet all the added things have to be subordinate to and not take away from the type.</p>
