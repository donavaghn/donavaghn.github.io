		<h1>BYU-Idaho Registration Process</h1>
		<section class='thin'>

			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>In this project I worked with a small group in order to come up with ideas to improve BYU Idaho’s registration system. My group was tasked with integrating registration tools into the registration system itself. There are quite a few useful tool for students. We wanted them to be able to access those tools without leaving the registration area.</p>

			<h3>Registration Tools</h3>

			<p>Some of the tools available to make registering easier for the students include Grad-Plan and a calendar. Grad-Plan allows students to plan out each of the classes they wish to take each semester, know what classes are offered each semester, and which ones they need to take to graduate. BYU Idaho has a built in calendar, but it is not very useful during registration, because it is not easily accessible during the registration process.</p>

			<h3>Problems</h3>

			<p>During our research we discovered several other problems. There is a lot of clutter within the registration process, both in the search form, and in the search results when listing available courses.</p>

			<p>There are many search fields shown be default that are rarely used and when listing classes it will show each section of each course, in some cases the different sections of the same course can fill several pages. Because of this making searching and finding classes easier also became one of our goals</p>

			<h3>User Information</h3>

			<p>Most of our research came from talking to students about how they use the registration process. We asked them about what their usual process was for registration, and what they liked and didn’t like about the registration system.</p>

			<p>Most students will write out their schedule on paper based on the classes they’ve decided to take with the help f the grad plan tool, and will use that to search for the classes they wish to take and iron out scheduling conflicts.</p>

			<h3>Integrating Systems</h3>

			<p>Most students believed the tools available were very helpful but were difficult to use during the registration process. Overall the students wanted to see the tools integrated into the registration system, to make registration easier.</p>

			<h3>Sketches</h3>

			<p>The first step was to make a few initial sketches of simpler ways to go about the registration process. We made several quick sketches and them began to make the Prototypes.</p>

			<h3>Prototypes</h3>

			<p>Paper prototypes are a simplified version of the digital process drawn out on paper in order to walk people through the process and quickly and easily make changes When new Problems arise. We made these Paper versions of the registration process tested them on about 3-4 different people, Made changes based on what we learned and repeated the process.</p>

			<h3>Scenarios</h3>

			<p>In order to learn as much as possible from the paper prototypes, and testing them with people we created three scenarios, so people would have the same goal, and we wouldn’t have to have a thousand different options. The scenarios include a background and three tasks.</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>

			<p>The university told you this semester for registration you can use the information from Grad-Plan to search your classes. You’ve updated your Grad-Plan and logged into the BYUI website to prepare to register.</p>

			<h2>Scenarios</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					You want to add a science class you have planned in your grad plan. You’ve been told you can now search planned classes without knowing their name or course code. Search for your planned courses and view the sections available for your science class.
				</li>
				<li>
					Now that you’ve seen the available courses you want to limit the results to classes that sit your schedule. Edit the search results to only show classes offered on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, exclude online and hybrid classes.
				</li>
				<li>
					You’ve narrowed the results down to two and want to no which one will not conflict with classes you planned previously. Use the available tools to see which fits into your schedule then add that class.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Learning from Prototypes</h2>

			<p>From the paper prototypes we were able to learn what navigation scheme felt more natural to students and what they looked for while registering. Each person in my design group took a sightly different approach to the design. That was helpful because we were able to share with each other what worked well in each design and use the pieces from each that functioned well.</p>

			<p>There were a couple aspect of the registration that I feltworked well as they were, but couldn’t tell if they worked in the prototypes because they were understandable or because students were used to it, so I tested the with a couple non-students as well.</p>

			</div>

			<h3>User Flow Map</h3>

			<p>Based on what we learned from our test we created a general path students would take through the registration process. Other members of my group opted for a shoping cart like system at the end which I chose to exclude to keep things simple.</p>

			<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>

			<p>Moving to digital prototyping is nice because it simulates using an electronic device better than paper. When using paper prototypes it’s hard to tell if something isn’t intuitive because the idea is bad or people just don’t think to scroll down when you hold a piece of paper in front of them.</p>

			<p>So after we’ve made it work as well as possible we created a digital version to learn how people treat it when it is done on a computer</p>

			<h3>Digital Testing</h3>

			<p>By testing users with the computer I learned that I needed to use symbols better. Many of the early icons were thrown together very quickly and weren’t always perfectly understandable to people, this would have been fixed in later a later design phase, but because of the tests I decided to do it sooner.</p>
		
			<p>The early digital tests lead to a lot of changes that wouldn’t have been obvious on paper. It’s nice to get past the early digital testing phase, because after that you can start caring about what thing look like.</p>

			<h2>Design Choices</h2>

			<h3>Color</h3>

			<p>In the design Phase I took a look at trying different colors. I tried a lot of different blues, because that is the color BYU-Idaho currently uses. I had designed a slimmer header to use in the prototype, so I used it to test color changes. Ultimately I used a mustard like color partially because I was tired of looking at blue. If they wanted to implement the design in the original blue it could be changed easily.</p>

			<h3>Simplifying</h3>

			<p>For early prototypes much of the design was simply screen shots from BYU-Idaho’s website. One of our goals was to simplify things, because the website can feel cluttered and difficult to navigate at times. My solution was to use some empty space to let things breath better, and compress some things that were larger than they needed to be such as the header.</p>

			<h3>Result of the changes</h3>

			<p>At first the switch to yellowish-orange was strange, but after getting used to it the color feels happy and calming. Having a narrow header felt really nice and made things feel less compressed and cluttered. After the changes I did a forth round of testing to ensure these changes didn’t cause any unintended confusion.</p>

			<h2>First and Final Digital Prototype Comparison</h2>

			<h3>What I've Learned</h3>

			<p>One interesting thing is even though there are several ways to get to the registration page almost nobody clicks the button on the homepage that says register. It’s stuck off to the side with the rest of the things that nobody looks at. Design is important because people don’t always look at everything, in fact there are a lot of things Online that we have developed a habit to ignore.</p>

			<p>Overall during this project I’ve learned that BYU-Idaho’s website could benefit from two things. First , Integrating registration tools into registration, and second, better use of visual hierarchy</p>
