		<h1>KidsBurg</h1>
		<section class='thin'>

			<p>The KidsBurg project was one of the bigger ones I’ve done. We spent quite a while on it and it still feels like I could have used a lot more time. It has been a heavy semester, despite that I think I’ve learned a lot from this project an have improved my ability to design in a few different ways.</p>

			<h3>Project Description</h3>

			<p>In this project we did a lot of things. We made a logo for KidsBurg, we made station logos for imaginary businesses, We chose typefaces that would match it all, described color usage and created examples of how it could all be used.</p>

			<p>With all that stuff we made a brand book that would help other designers design future parts of the business in the same style. I went for a minimalistic look and even then there was a lot of things to organize on the pages.</p>

			<h3>What has been done before?</h3>

			<p>Previously the goal of providing a safe and fun environment for children to play and learn has been either at parks and playgrounds or yards and homes. The designs and color schemes of playgrounds and toys used by children between 18 months to 12 years of age is something important to consider as they are colors they are familiar with and relate to.</p>

			<p>In both cases several bright colors are usually used. The four most common are blue, yellow, green, and red. Which is also a mix of the additive and subtractive primary colors, which may help somewhat is the aspect of educating children.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Research</h2>

			<h3>Colors in Toys</h3>

			<p>Interestingly these four colors (blue, yellow, green, and red) stay vary common in the use of toy design for children through the span of our target are group (18 months - 8 years old)</p>

			<p>From large plastic rings for very young children to Knex building set pieces which would be a choking hazard for those young children but a great mind building toy for older children keeps the same color scheme.
			</p>

			<p>The bright primary colors that are a perfect pick for very young children stay the same and just as valid all the way through the targeted age group.</p>

			<h3>Signs and Type</h3>

			</div>
			

			<p>The majority of type and signs for playgrounds is directed at adult supervision. So quite often playground signs end up looking very boring. Signs directed at children use the same bold San-serif type faces and add an interesting twist, like color or texture.</p>

			<h2>Sketches and early renditions</h2>
			
			<h3>Sketching</h3>

			<p>A lot of people dislike doing sketches for projects, but I like getting ideas out on paper. It’s a lot faster and I feel like it’s easier for my brain and imagination to flow on paper and not on a computer. I’ll often sketch more after while I’m working on the final design on the computer.</p>

			<h3>KidsBurg Logo Thoughts</h3>
			
			<img class='left' src='Images/kidsburg/logos/wideLogo.png' style="margin-bottom: 45px;">

			<p>After finding the logo I liked it took a while to get to look right. I went through several refinement sketches and digital compositions. One thing that took me a while to figure and fix was once I made them fit into a circle they looked violent, like they were bullying the middle person, in the end the problem was solved by turning the heads out.</p>

			<h3>Type Kit</h3>

			<p>I originally used a different type face, but our client asked for a font from type kit so their designers could have easy free access to it. It ended up working really well. I hadn’t used type-kit before, so I was also happy to learn about it. It is a great resource.</p>

			<h3>Station Logos</h3>
			
			<div class='doubleright'>
				<img src='Images/kidsburg/logos/corn.png'>
				<img src='Images/kidsburg/logos/hammer.png'>
			</div>

			<p>I’m happy with how the station logos turned out. There were a few things I had to simplify and some changes I had to make, but I’m happy with it. I used a style involving simple flat shapes to make a full picture. The goal of this was to make it easy for future designers to make more in the same style.</p>

			<h3>Project Thoughts</h3>

			<p>I feel like I was able to learn a lot from this project, one thing that was nice is that because we had so many different types of work for the project including Icon and logo design, Photoshop Work, and layout Design, I was able to compare my strengths and weaknesses and see where I need to improve.</p>

			<h3>Type-Kit</h3>

			<p>I hadn’t used type-Kit before it was a requirement for this project. My mind was blown! Finding and downloading fonts is usually a pain in the butt, and most of the time any font you don’t pay for is crap and only comes in one weight. I guess you don’t technically Get these for free either because it’s through the Adobe CC, but at least while the school covers that it’s pretty much free. They are super easy to sync too. I feel like I belong in one of those church talks where they talk about people are living bellow their privileges.</p>

			<h3>Logo Use Guide</h3>

			<p>The things we did to give examples of how to use the logo was interesting. I’ve never done anything like that. Doing the safe space was fun, and it was cool to see the it used in so many ways, good and bad. I learned a lot from that part.</p>

			<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

			<p>I wish would have taken this class on a less busy semester. It was a really fun project and Would have loved to have been able to dedicate more time to it. If nothing else the KidsBurg project was a great learning experience.</p>

			<p>The other thing that was neat that kind of applies for the last project as well is that it’s different designing for someone in specific. You have to consider their thoughts and not just yours.</p>
