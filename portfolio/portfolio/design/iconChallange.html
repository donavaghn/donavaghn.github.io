		<h1>Poison and Medicine Icons</h1>
		<section class='thin'>

			<h3>Visual Research and Brain Storming</h3>

			<p>Most of my research was talking to people and asking their opinions. The difficulty of this project was mostly trying to get the icon to say one thing and one thing only. Visual research helped me get started, but there was only so much I could get from it.</p>

			<p>As I was sketching or working on my digital works. I would ask what it looked like to them and if they said anything other than poison or medicine I would try to figure out why and make adjustments. It is really hard to find something that says medicine without saying a specific type of medicine.</p>

			<h3>Medicine</h3>

			<p>Coming up with variations for medicine was pretty easy, but I had the same problem with all of them. They were all types of medicine. Even if I used a medicine container it would say first aid kit or pill bottle or whatever it was.</p>

			<h3>Poisen</h3>

			<p>Poison was a little easier than medicine. I still had some of the same issues. People would say alcohol, or other things that went with the icon. Nobody said pirate, but I got alcohol a few times. I used a pickle shaped jar so people wouldn’t say alcohol. There weren’t any other words that came up after that. Because nobody puts a skull and cross bones on their pickle jar.</p>

			<h3>Finding Ideas</h3>

			<p>Coming up with the first couple ideas was pretty easy, but after that it got a little bit harder. It got a little harder after that. I came up with a lot of ideas for medicine, but like I talked about earlier it’s hard to think of something that says medicine without saying a type of medicine. I found a few ideas just by google searching, and a few more by talking to people. A lot of my ideas came from sketching and thinking.</p>

			<h3>Digital Work</h3>

			<p>It had been a while since the last time I did something similar. I really enjoy doing this type of thing. Like with the Photoshop activity I had to relearn where a coupe of tools are. I remembered this one a little faster. I think I’ve used Illustrator a little more than Photoshop.</p>

			<h3>Perry's  Thoughts</h3>

			<p>Listening to the five steps of thought process (I don’t remember the specific name) was really interesting I think understanding the second one was important to this project because sometimes everyone would see something different.
			</p>

			<p>If I hadn’t thought about how other people see things their own way. My final icon would have been totally different. Asking people what they saw was a lot of what I did while working on this project.
			</p>

			<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

			<p>I really enjoyed this project. It presented some challenged I didn’t expect. But it was fun trying to get it to work right and refine the ideas. I really enjoyed working with the people in my group. It’s always great to get other people’s input who are working on the same type of thing.</p>
