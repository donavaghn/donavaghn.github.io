		<h1>Cooking App Prototype</h1>
		<section class='thin'>

			<h3>Project Concept</h3>

			<p>This purpose of this project was not only to create a design that would look nice, but also be intuitive and easily to understand to as many people as possible. I have some experience designing websites and things that people interact with, so this project allowed me to improve those skills and have a better understanding of the details of how people see an interface.</p>

			<p>I did get a bit caught up in making things understandable and easy to navigate. While I don’t think it’s the best looking thing I’ve ever made, I was able to make something that was easily understandable to those who tried it. </p>

			<h3>Designing for Usability</h3>

			<p>In project, reading and discussion in class we learned a lot about how people see, understand and use thing. It has been very educational for me. I’m a little undecided on what I want to do after collage.</p>

			<p>One of the options I am currently considering is web development, and the things we’ve studied and applied while working on this project definitely apply to that. </p>

			<h3>My Project</h3>

			<p>While I was trying to find an idea for what kind of calculator to design, I thought of my wife who uses a lot of recipes ask for ingredients by weight. The difficulty in converting weight to volume is that you have to know the mass of the ingredient you’re weighing, so and App that makes the conversions for you would be relatively easy to program and incredibly useful for people who find themselves in the same predicament my wife often did. </p>

			<p>We have since bought a scale, but I assumed we weren’t the only ones who have had that problem. I checked online to see if any Apps did the same thing and while there were a few they were confusing and looked very boring.</p>

			<h2>Research</h2>

			<h3>Considering Concepts</h3>

			<p>Starting to look for an idea for a calculator was difficult, because at first I had no idea what to do. One thing that helped was looking at a website I found that had a collection of a bunch of different calculators. The site Calculator.net has at least 40 different calculators.</p>

			<p>Seeing that there are a ton of things in our day to day life that can be calculated help me open up my mind a little bit.</p>

			<h3>Finding My Idea</h3>

			<p>I was looking at a few calculators for the kitchen and I thought of the biggest problem my wife has with kitchen measurements, which is converting volume into weight, and so the idea came.</p>

			<p>To know how much a certain amount of an ingredient weighs you either have to weigh it or know how much a certain amount weighs and do some math. This can get complicated when you’re working with a bunch of ingredients, an app that remembers it all for you and does the math would help a lot.</p>

			<h3>Competitive Research</h3>

			<p>After I thought of the idea of a volume to weight kitchen converter I opened up the App Store on my phone to see if there were any similar Apps.</p>

			<p>I found a few that have the same functions, but each of them had a lot of room for improvement. A lot of them looked fairly ugly and many of them were a little confusing.</p>

			<h2>developing a concept</h2>
			<h3>Initial Concept</h3>

			<p>As explored in the research phase the concept of the App it to convert the weight of cooking ingredients into volume.</p>

			<p>The App would need to know what weight measurement your using, but I decided in order to simplify things I would have the App return the value measurement as a type that is chosen automatically based on how much you are converting. The App could have a set point at which if the quantity of measurement exceeded a certain number it would use the next largest measure this way the user would have to select if the wanted their answer in cup or tablespoons and the App wouldn’t return 400 tablespoons as the output to your conversion.</p>

			<h3>Other functions</h3>

			<p>As part of the assignment we were required to have three functions. Thinking of another two was a little difficult because I had tried to simplify the App as much as possible.
			</p>

			<p>The first function I decided to add was the ability to add a new ingredient. There are some uncommon ingredients that only a few people use and if the App were to actually be made you could really only spend so much time adding ingredients before making the App available to people.</p>

			<p>The second thing I decided to add was a favorites button. Enough ingredients would be added that finding some of them could be difficult, and a favorites tab would make finding the ingredients</p>

			<h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>

			<h3>As apposed to screens</h3>

			<p>On paper I can work a lot faster. I did a whole bunch of sketches early prototype drawings. Paper allows us to work quickly and loosely and explore ideas more efficiently. </p>

			<p>The one downside I noticed it that when people are testing a paper prototype is that although they are imagining it as a phone they don’t think about some of the conventions that come with using phone. In one of my paper prototypes I wanted people to swipe down to find more ingredients and almost nobody would try swiping down. I tried showing signifiers that scrolling was possible, but nobody really thought to do it until I switched to using my phone as a prototype. On the phone everyone would scroll down without any questions. Testing on paper really help see what how people see different icons and buttons as different things and what there instinct for looking for something is.</p>

			<h3>Paper VS. Screen</h3>

			<p>It was interesting to see the advantages of doing user testing on paper and the advantages of doing it on a screen. I can work faster on paper, so it allowed me to see what worked and what didn’t and quickly make another paper prototype. There were a lot of design changes that happed quickly with the paper prototype.
			</p>

			<p>While the working with the screen prototype there were far fewer changes and they happened much slower, the screen came with the advantages that people were able to navigate easily because they didn’t have to imagine as much, and reading typed text is easier than my handwriting.</p>

			<h3>User Testing</h3>

			<p>User testing was an interesting and educational experience, because there are some conventions that some people expect and others don’t. During testing people talked about things that they would have expected that I didn’t think of and there are some conventions that I expected people to follow that they didn’t. Overall it was very helpful and allowed me to better understand of people understand things. Scenarios.
			</p>


			<h2>Scenarios</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>You just downloaded a new cooking app that converts weight measurements to volume measurements. Your currently trying out a new recipe you found, it calls for 240 grams of flour, and you don’t have a scale. Use the App to convert 240 grams of flour into cups. </li>

				<li>You’ve been using the App for a while now, and many of your favorite recipes call for molasses, and your kind of tired of scrolling down to find it. Add molasses to your favorites. </li>

				<li>A few of the recipes you use involve corn, but that the App doesn’t include corn. You checked online and corn weighs 5 ounces per cup. Add corn to the App. </li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Selecting Weight</h3>

			<p>One of the things user testing on paper made obvious was that the drop down to the right of the input field was often overlooked and people would enter in the number without changing the weight unit.</p>

			<p>The first solution I tried was to show the weights before this screen as depicted in the top left image before moving onto the next screen, so people could not miss it. Eventually the issue was solved simply by putting the weight selection next to the keypad, and the user tests showed that people were able to tell that was something they needed to pay attention to.</p>

			<h3>Other Fixes</h3>

			<p>The user tests were also nice becasue I was able to get feedback on the icons and other little things that greatly effect readability. Although I was able to get a lot of feedback on functionality and understandability, I feel like my biggest mistake in the project was not getting more feedback and critique in regards to design.</p>

			<h3>Color and Contrast</h3>

			<p>After the paper prototypes and a couple of digital drafts, I had the layout of the App where I wanted it and it was easy to navigate. The top left image shows the most used screen of the App in its almost completed state. I had done a lot of user tests up to this point both on paper and on the screen, and now needed to make it look better.</p>

			<p>Most people I asked liked the layout and images apart for a few icon critiques. The obvious problem was color and contrast. I improved contrast by first converting the image to gray-scale and adjusting values before adding colors that match those values.</p>

			<p>After several color variation I decided that the best option was to make a more saturated version of the original orange the secondary color and make the primary color blue. The color changes and some small icon tweaks greatly improved the design.</p>

			<h2>Final Prototype</h2>

			<h3>Functionality</h3>

			<p>The images to the right show the three functions of the App.

			The First and third function happen on the same screen. In my opinion the more you are able to simplify things the easier it is for people to understand them.</p>

			<p>I think I achieved my goal of designing the App in a way that was simple and easy to understand. After I had finished it, I had a few people test the App and everyone was able to easily navigate it.</p>

			<h3>Design</h3>

			<p>I got close to where I wanted the design to be. I do wish I would have spent more time flushing colors and refining the layout.

			That area lacking a little in my view does make some sense, because had few bugs and sicknesses on and off I might revisit the design and see if I can improve it later, but I tell myself that about a lot of projects, so we’ll see.</p>
