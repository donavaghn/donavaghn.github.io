<img src="images/corbets.png" alt="Descent of corbet's couloir"><p>Anyone who has ever skied or snowboarded Jackson Hole knows just how nerve-racking it can be to send it into the infamous Corbet's Couloir, even in the best of conditions. Doing it in icy conditions on mountain bikes is nothing short of insane, and that's exactly what Cam McCaul and Casey Brown did in TGR's latest film, Rogue Elements.

There's a litany of other adjectives you could prescribe to the lines McCaul and Brown threw down - Sketchy, heavy, and borderline suicidal all come to mind - but ultimately, the end result was jaw-dropping.</p></article>

<article><img src="images/nate_hills_crash.png" alt="Nate Hills"><p>Mountain Biker Nate Hills was taking advantage of the epic fall riding conditions near Crested Butte, CO when he happened to film his riding buddy and fellow Yeti racer Tom Sampson go down hard. Halfway down the epic Doctorâ€™s Park trail, in a super-flowy section commonly ridden at speeds over 30 mph, Sampson hit a freshly downed tree and went straight over the bars. Luckily, he walked away with just a broken wrist and elbow from a crash that could have been much, much worse.</p></article>

<article><img src="images/matt_jones.png" alt="Matt Jones"><p>Ever heard of slopestyle mountain biker Matt Jones? Well, now you have. Jones, a young English rider is well on his way to give big names like Semenuk and Genon a run for their money. His new short film, Frames of Mind, looks into his mind as he visualizes and then executes next-level tricks, most of these don't even have names. See for yourself, this is creativity at its finest.</p>
